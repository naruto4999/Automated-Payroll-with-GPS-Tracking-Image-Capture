Practice:
-> Using Mnist dataset without normalizing(the guy in the video called it scaling for some reason so check that later) (meaning using the values from 0 - 255) the accurarcy was "88.65%"
-> After normalizing the accurarcy was "92.57%"
-> With no hidden layers my model was this ```model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,), activation='sigmoid')
])```
-> With hidden layers and with normalizing my accuracy was "98.35%" and model was ```model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(100, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')
])```

Using cifar10 dataset:
-> using normal ANN got the accuracy of "49.38%" using the model: ```ann = keras.models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(32,32,3)),
    layers.Dense(3000, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1000, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid'),
])```
and the optimizer ```ann.compile(
    optimizer='SGD',
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=['accuracy']
)```
